# Dockerized Micro-Services for Maximally Flexible SaaS <br/> that Enable Timely Responses to Unforeseen Events <br/> in Geo-Distributed Semi-Autonomous Multi-Agent <br/> Systems for Reconfigurable Manufacturing and more
 
This repository contains software artifacts and documentation related to an organised set of dockerized micro-services designed and developed in the last few years in the Data Science Institute at University of Galway under the supervision of Prof. John Gerard Breslin, and that allow to install, configure, operate and alter any software on any Docker-equipped device from remote and with unlimited flexibility, securely and reliably, enabling timely responses to unforeseen events in geographically distributed semi-autonomous multi-agent systems, for reconfigurable manufacturing, smart cities, and more. Inspectability is also a key feature of this software.

## Get started

As said, what is proposed in this GitHub repository are micro-services. To get started, you will then be driven through some example usages of these micro-services. This is done through a Postman collection of API requests. All requests are extensively commented, and request/response examples are provided. Details about how to produce customized micro-services starting from the default implementations that are available in this repository are also given along the way. The Postman collection is available [online](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16531967/2s8ZDbUfCC), or you may want to import the [GettingStarted.postman_collection](https://github.com/mircosoderi/State-of-the-art-Artifacts-for-Big-Data-Engineering-and-Analytics-as-a-Service/blob/main/GettingStarted.postman_collection) in your local Postman installation and run the APIs and read their associated documentation from there. Docker is required. Exposing Docker daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS is also required; Windows users can do that from the General Settings of Docker Desktop, while Linux users may find [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52838808/how-to-enable-expose-daemon-on-tcp-localhost2375-without-tls-on-mac) useful but they have to mind the port number. Postman users have to [configure](https://blog.postman.com/using-self-signed-certificates-with-postman/) the application so that it does not reject self-signed certificates. [Times of response](https://github.com/mircosoderi/State-of-the-art-Artifacts-for-Big-Data-Engineering-and-Analytics-as-a-Service/blob/main/GettingStarted.xlsx) observed running the getting started collection on a HP 250 G8 notebook (Microsoft Windows 10 Home, Intel Core I5 1035G1 CPU @ 1GHz, quad-core, RAM 16 GB) are available.
